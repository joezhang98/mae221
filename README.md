# MAE221: Thermodynamics
Python code from MAE 221: Thermodynamics (Fall 2016).  

Labs 1-4 involved the programming of sensors and a Photon device to accomplish a given task, such as the design of a smart water heater with automatic shut-off at a specified temperature (Lab 1), verification of the Ideal Gas Law through data collection with thermistors and linear potentiometers (Lab 2), and the design of a smart shower system using pulsed width modulation (PWM) to control the pump rate of separate hot and cold water streams.

The Design Problem was an end-of-the-semester project involving the design and optimization of a modern power plant subject to performance and environmental constraints.
